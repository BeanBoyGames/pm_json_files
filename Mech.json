For any bomb that has no phones or laptops welded to it, there’s a good old fashioned heavily shielded arm with enough articulation to replace a pacemaker. These things are so safe, the pilots don’t even break a sweat anymore.",

These units are very heavily reinforced, especially around the Pneumatic Applicators (the fists), with a frame so heavy that, a pilot bringing a building down on themselves is a legitimate strategy. By the way, standing in a doorway isn’t going to protect you from what this guy can do.\n\n-C.S. Garcia",

Comes with a few really big guns and knives. They’re incredibly light on their feet for their size, and they make great people movers. Make sure that you don’t put action heroes inside these guys, they usually end up acting like jackasses and getting shot right through the cockpit by actual competent pilots.\n\n-C.S. Garcia",
